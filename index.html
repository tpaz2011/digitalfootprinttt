          Never share passwords with others. Passwords are personal and should be protected as much as you protect the keys to your house.<br>
          You should never click on sites that seem questionable. Only use information from reputable sites.<br>
          You never share that you are home alone. Posting that you are home without adult supervision may put you at risk for unwanted visitors.<br>
          It’s best to only share information with close friends and family members.
